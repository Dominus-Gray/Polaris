## user_problem_statement: 
The user has identified multiple critical issues and requirements that need to be implemented:

1. **Dashboard Navigation Issue**: Dashboard navigates to Business Profile instead of Client Home
2. **Client Home Requirements**: Need comprehensive dashboard with assessment status, gaps, service requests, agency info, and dynamic free services
3. **Knowledge Base Integration**: Not properly integrated into client user journey
4. **Assessment System Enhancements**: 
   - Missing evidence upload functionality
   - Gap identification logic (no answer OR "No, I need help" = gap)
   - "No, I need help" should be highlighted red
   - Free resources flow after gap identification
   - Professional help flow with service provider matching
5. **Service Provider Matching System**: Complete marketplace with notifications and matching
6. **Business Profile**: Remove "describe your services in detail"
7. **Analytics**: Resource usage tracking for navigators

# New E2E Test Plan (All roles)

# Added Opportunities & Matching tests (Phase: Bigger Bets)
- Agency creates opportunity (POST /api/opportunities)
- Public/Client lists opportunities (GET /api/opportunities)
- Agency lists own (GET /api/opportunities/mine)
- Client applies (POST /api/opportunities/{id}/apply)
- Matching scores available (GET /api/opportunities/{id}/matches) using assessment answers

- Create navigator -> approve agency -> agency issues license -> client registers -> provider registers -> navigator approves provider -> client assessment 'No, I need help' logs analytics -> client creates service request area5 -> provider responds -> client views responses -> payment attempt -> knowledge base unlock attempt -> navigator analytics reflects resource selection.
- Record any missing endpoints or gaps as issues with suggested fixes.
